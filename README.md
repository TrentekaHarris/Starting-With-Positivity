## Description
This application provides a random positive quote. There is also an option to get the weather of a city of your choice.

## Usage

This application was created to showcase my JavaScript coding skills. You will be required to input your name for the application to work.

You will then be prompted to enter your desired city. This will allow you to get the weather for that location. This is not required for the application to work.

Afterwards you will see a random quote and the weather if you elected to input a city
